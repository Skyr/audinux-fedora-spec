Xsynth-DSSI 0.9.4 Release Notes

Xsynth-DSSI is a classic-analog (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software
synthesizer which operates as a plugin for the DSSI Soft Synth
Interface.

Changes since version 0.9.2: this release, which adds no new
synthesis features, fixes a number of minor bugs, makes patch
handling more robust across locales, and uses cairo (when
available) to draw nicer knobs in the GUI.
